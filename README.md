We have deposited scripts used to process and analyse sequencing and mass spectrometry data described in the pre-print. We have also provided extensive details on the re-analysis of publicly available data on ZNF143, which is an essential part of the manuscript.

Raw sequencing and mass spectrometry data from the pre-print can be found in GEO ([GSE260914](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE260914) and [GSE271837](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE271837)) and PRIDE ([PXD049480](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD049480)) databases.

If you have any questions about the data analysis in the preprint or the scripts in the repository, please email m.magnitov[at]nki.nl or e.d.wit[at]nki.nl.
